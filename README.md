### üîß **Technical Excellence**
- **React 18 SSR**: Server-side rendering optimized for val.town
- **AT Protocol Integration**: Native support for decentralized protocols
- **Deno Runtime**: Modern ESM imports, no Node.js dependencies
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with comprehensive interfaces
- **Server-side Caching**: 1-hour cache for all external API calls

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Format code
deno fmt

# Lint code  
deno lint

# Deploy to val.town
deno task deploy
```

## üåç Content Sources

The website automatically aggregates content from:

- **[Leaflet Publication](https://tijs.leaflet.pub/)** - Blog posts and articles
- **[DropAnchor](https://dropanchor.app/)** - Location check-ins via AT Protocol
- **[Bookhive](https://bookhive.buzz/)** - Book reading updates via AT Protocol
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/tijs)** - Open source projects and contributions

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `ATPROTO_HANDLE`: Your AT Protocol handle (defaults to "tijs.org")
- `LEAFLET_PUB_JSON`: URL to your Leaflet publication JSON feed

### Customization

The website is designed to be easily customizable:
- Update personal information in `components/ProfileHeader.tsx`
- Modify app showcase in `components/AppsSection.tsx`
- Adjust color themes in component stylesheets
- Configure external links in `components/ExternalLinks.tsx`

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Personal Nexus uses **server-side rendering** to generate HTML with dynamic content from multiple decentralized sources:

1. **AT Protocol Integration**: Connects directly to your PDS (Personal Data Server)
2. **Data Aggregation**: Fetches and combines content from various platforms
3. **Server-side Caching**: Implements intelligent caching to reduce API calls
4. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Handles network issues and missing data elegantly

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with server-side rendering
- **Runtime**: Deno with modern ESM imports
- **Hosting**: Val.town platform
- **Protocols**: AT Protocol (@atproto/api)
- **Languages**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS with responsive design

## üìã Requirements

- Deno runtime
- Val.town account for hosting
- AT Protocol handle for decentralized content
- Optional: Custom domain setup
